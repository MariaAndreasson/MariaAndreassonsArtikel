<h2>TOXICITY OF BILE FROM FISH EXPOSED TO
    PENTACHLOROPHENOL-SPIKED SEDIMENT</h2>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>
Many pollutants are concentrated in <wrap>
sediments as well as in the bile of fish.
In order to evaluate if toxicity of fish
bile can be used to determine lethal and
sublethal exposure to pollutants, 
rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)were
exposed to pentachlorophenol-(PCP)
spiked sediment. PCP was added to a 
natural fresh water sediment at conc-
entrations of 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 mg
PCP/kg wet weight (w/w) and equilibra->
ted with water at 10% sediment in water.
Trout were exposed for 1 or 2 clays, 
sacrificed and their bile was tested for
toxicity to Daphnia magna. Exposure was
monitored daily by toxicity tests of
sediment and water using D. magna. 
Twenty-four hour EC50s, expressed as mg
PCP/kg sediment w/w (mean +/-SD, N=5),
were 20 +/-6.4 for sediment and 9.6 +/- 
5.1 for water phase tests, respectively.
The corresponding sediment 24-h LC50 
for rainbow trout was ca 16 mg/kg w/w
Toxicity of bile was tested directly
and after extraction with acetone-
hexane (1:3, v/v). Prior to extraction,
subsamples of bile were hydrolyzed by
acid (pH 3.5 at 70 degrees C for 3 h)
and beta-glucuronidase (pH 5.0 at 40
degrees C for 3 h). Bile and bile 
extract toxicity in surviving trouts
exposed to the median lethal sediment
concentration (16 mg PCP/kg w/w)      <img src="images/15296121.jpg">
was > 10 x more toxic than bile from
control fish, and hydrolyzed bile
extract from fish exposed to 4 mg
PCP/kg sediment was 10-50 x more
toxic than from control fish. Thus,
toxicity tests with extracts of
hydrolyzed bile were more 
sensitive than toxicity tests
with water and sediment. Therefore,
at least for chemicals readily
excreted through the bile, toxicity
tests may be used to quantify
sublethal exposure in fish.
